# 📊 Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health – Power BI Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Remote and hybrid work arrangements have become standard practice across industries, offering employees greater flexibility and better work-life integration. However, these work models also introduce challenges such as heightened stress, increased social isolation, and mental health concerns.

This project analyses a dataset of **5,000 employees worldwide** to uncover the relationship between **remote work** and **employee mental well-being**.  
The goal is to derive **actionable insights** that organisations can use to design effective policies for supporting remote workers.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Design
The dashboard was designed to provide a **holistic view** of employee mental health under remote work arrangements.  
It consists of **interactive KPI cards**, **charts**, and **filters** to allow HR professionals and decision-makers to drill down into specific segments.

### ✅ KPI Section (Top Row)
- Displays **Total Employees**, **Total Remote Workers**, **Remote Work Satisfaction**, and **Average Stress Score**.  
- These KPIs provide an **instant overview** of workforce composition and well-being metrics.

### ✅ Demographic Analysis
- **Age Group Distribution (Bar Chart)**: Shows how remote employees are spread across age groups, with most being between **26–55 years**.  
- **Job Role Distribution (Bar Chart)**: Highlights that roles such as **HR**, **Data Science**, and **Software Engineering** have the highest remote representation.

### ✅ Mental Health Analysis
- **Mental Health Condition (Doughnut Chart)**: Depicts the prevalence of conditions like **Anxiety**, **Burnout**, and **Depression**, with **Burnout** being slightly more prominent.  
- **Stress Level Distribution (Bar Chart)**: Shows that a significant portion of remote employees experience **high** or **medium** stress.

### ✅ Satisfaction and Isolation Ratings
- **Remote Work Satisfaction (Table)**: Reveals that **only 33.5%** of employees report satisfaction, while a large portion remains **neutral** or **unsatisfied**.  
- **Social Isolation Rating (Bar Chart)**: Illustrates that **moderate to high** levels of isolation are prevalent, with only a small group experiencing very low isolation.

### ✅ Regional Distribution
- **Remote Employees by Region (Map Visual)**: Highlights the geographical spread of employees, with visible concentrations in **North America**, **Europe**, and **Asia**.

### ✅ Filter by Years of Experience
- A slicer allows analysis of **stress**, **isolation**, and **satisfaction patterns** across different experience levels.

## 📈 Key Insights Derived from the Dashboard

### 🔹 Remote Work Participation
- Out of **5,000 employees**, **1,714 (34%)** work remotely.  
- This indicates that remote work adoption is **substantial but not dominant**.

### 🔹 Stress Levels Remain High
- **High stress (590)** and **medium stress (577)** dominate, while **low stress (547)** is slightly less common.  
- This reflects that **remote work alone does not mitigate stress**; in fact, it may **amplify stress** in certain environments.

### 🔹 Low Remote Work Satisfaction
- Only **33.5%** of remote employees are satisfied, with **603** neutral and **592** unsatisfied.  
- Dissatisfaction may stem from **inadequate support structures** and **increased feelings of isolation**.

### 🔹 Mental Health Conditions
- Mental health issues are widespread, with:
  - **Burnout**: 25.9%  
  - **Anxiety**: 24.1%  
  - **Depression**: 25.6%  
- This highlights the **urgent need** for mental health resources across the board.

### 🔹 Age Group Analysis
- The highest number of remote employees falls in the **26–45** age range, groups that are typically more adaptable to remote work but also face **high performance pressures**.

### 🔹 Social Isolation
- Isolation ratings are distributed across moderate levels, with many employees experiencing scores **between 2 and 4**.  
- This suggests that remote workers frequently **miss interpersonal connections**, contributing to **lower satisfaction**.

### 🔹 Regional Variation
- Remote work is strong in regions with **better digital infrastructure** (North America, Europe).  
- The degree of **stress** and **isolation** may vary regionally, which organisations should **factor into policy design**.

## 🧩 Factors Driving These Challenges
- **Workload Intensity** (hours worked per week → stress)  
- **Low Company Support** (leading to low satisfaction and higher isolation)  
- **High-Demand Roles** (HR, IT) show **higher stress** due to workload.  
- **Younger Employees (<30)** report **more stress** due to career pressure.  
- **Older Employees (>35)** face stress adapting to digital tools and balancing family responsibilities.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
1. **Targeted Wellness Programmes**  
   - Tailor mental health support by demographic (e.g., personal/career development plan for younger employees, flexible schedules for older workers).

2. **Enhance Virtual Engagement**  
   - Implement frequent check-ins, team-building virtual sessions, and mentorship programmes to combat isolation.

3. **Well-being Incentives**  
   - Encourage physical activity with wellness challenges and gym stipends.  
   - Partner with mental health platforms for 24/7 support.

4. **Continuous Feedback Loops**  
   - Conduct quarterly surveys to track changes in stress and satisfaction levels.  
   - Use analytics (like this project) to refine policies continually.
